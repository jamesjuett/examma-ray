/**
 * ## Exam Specification
 * 
 * The general structure of an exam specification is:
 *  - [[QuestionSpecification]]s with content for individual questions.
 *  - [[SectionSpecification]]s with content for sections and that specify which questions they contain.
 *  - An [[ExamSpecification]] with content for the overall exam and that specifies which sections it contains.
 * 
 * ### IDs
 * 
 * Question, section, and exam specifications require unique IDs. (They must be unique within their individual
 * component specification category - e.g. it would be ok to have a question and section with the same ID.)
 * 
 * Valid IDs must start with a letter and may contain letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes (i.e. they
 * must match the regex `/^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_\-]*$/`). The [[isValidID]] function tests this.
 * 
 * Student "uniqnames" are also required to meet these same criteria.
 * 
 * When a question/section/exam is assigned to a student, it is given a UUID, with these original IDs used
 * as part of the seed (assuming one of the deterministic UUID generation policies is used). So, don't change
 * the IDs after you've started giving/grading an exam (or ideally don't change them EVER once a question is
 * put into some use).
 * 
 * ### Specifying Question/Section Choosers
 * 
 * Questions within a [[SectionSpecification]] are given as a list of specific questions or [[QuestionChooser]]s
 * that assign a (potentially different) subset of questions to each individual student. You may create custom
 * question choosers or use predefined factory functions to create them:
 *  - [[RANDOM_QUESTION]]
 *  - [[RANDOM_BY_TAG]]
 * 
 * Sections within an [[ExamSpecification]] are given as a list of specific sections or [[SectionChooser]]s
 * that assign a (potentially different) subset of sections to each individual student. You may create custom
 * section choosers or use predefined factory functions to create them:
 *  - [[RANDOM_SECTION]]
 * 
 * ### Randomizing Question/Section Ordering
 * 
 * Use [[SHUFFLE]] to randomize the ordering (on a per-student basis) of a list of questions or sections.
 * 
 * ### Customizing Existing Specifications
 * 
 * Use the [[CUSTOMIZE]] function if you've got an existing specification (e.g. from a question bank) that
 * you just need to tweak slightly.
 * 
 * ### Student information
 * 
 * Presently, the only information needed for students are names and "uniqnames", which are a unique
 * identifier for each student. These must satisfy the same
